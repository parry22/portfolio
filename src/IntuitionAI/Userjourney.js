                I had ideas. A lot. However, not all of them were feasible. So, I had to check in with stakeholders frequently to see if this new any new design idea fit their current product agenda. 
                Following that, I used to meet with our engineering team to determine the technical feasibility of my ideas. Lo-fi wireframes were extremely helpful in this process in determining how to implement my ideas and receive feedback on them from various perspectives.
